ai-indent
==============================

## Version 1

Version 1 of the model was the first version that I tried out in VSCode using the model to predict indentation of the next line, making use of the ontypeformatting call that's part of the LSP. This "worked", and was right a good percentage of the time, and was responsive (inference time took about 3ms, even running on CPU).

Using this, two areas of potential improvement that we identified were:
- No context after the cursor position. Context which could turn a blind guess into a certainty
- Context gained after typing the next line could be used to re-predict the line with much better accuracy

## Version 2

#### Planned improvements/work
1. Predict next line, and re-predict current line
  - Only re-predict current line if the line has been modified (e.g. formatters which take into account git history)
2. Give the model context before and after the cursor

## Version 3

#### Planned improvements/work

1. Take into account the type and amount of indexation set in the IDE 
   - This should also have a way of saying 'undefined indentation settings'
   - It should also be able to identify files that have different styles, and so the IDE should be ignored
2. To produce training data of mixed indentation styles (e.g. tabs vs spaces), I plan to make use of some Ada formatter...
